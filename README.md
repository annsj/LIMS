# LIMS
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)

In this project a system for automation of calculations and database interactions for a common laboratory analysis was developed. The system is made up of three micro services; a User Interface (UI), a Camunda process for automation and a GraphQL API for interactions with a relational database. A user can select samples, start an analysis, select a raw data file from which the process will perform calculations and accept the result after review. The process interacts with the API to save data in the database. Camundaâ€™s process modelling tool and process engine were used for automation.
